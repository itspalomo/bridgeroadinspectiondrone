[4.824s] CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
[4.825s]   By not providing "Findlibseek.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
[4.826s]   asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "libseek", but
[4.827s]   CMake did not find one.
[4.827s] 
[4.828s]   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "libseek" with any
[4.829s]   of the following names:

[4.830s]     libseekConfig.cmake
[4.831s]     libseek-config.cmake
[4.834s] 
[4.836s]   Add the installation prefix of "libseek" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
[4.838s]   "libseek_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
[4.840s]   "libseek" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has
[4.842s]   been installed.
