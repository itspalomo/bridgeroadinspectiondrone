  By not providing "Findlibseek-thermal_SOURCE.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "libseek-thermal_SOURCE", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "libseek-thermal_SOURCE" with any of the following names:

    libseek-thermal_SOURCEConfig.cmake
    libseek-thermal_source-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "libseek-thermal_SOURCE" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "libseek-thermal_SOURCE_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "libseek-thermal_SOURCE" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
