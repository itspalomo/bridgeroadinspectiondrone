[4.595s] CMake Warning at CMakeLists.txt:28 (find_package):
[4.595s]   By not providing "Findseek.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
[4.596s]   asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "seek", but
[4.596s]   CMake did not find one.
[4.597s] 
[4.598s]   Could not find a package configuration file provided by "seek" with any of
[4.598s]   the following names:

[4.600s] 
[4.601s]   Add the installation prefix of "seek" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
[4.601s]   "seek_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "seek"
[4.602s]   provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
[4.603s]   installed.
